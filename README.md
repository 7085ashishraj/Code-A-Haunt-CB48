Problem Statement : Food waste reduction solution
Problem statement number : CBP14
Ideas regarding project : Smart Refrigerator Inventory Management:
Create a system that uses RFID or barcode technology to track the items in a refrigerator. The system can notify users about the expiration dates of products and suggest recipes based on the available ingredients. This helps users use perishable items before they go bad.

Community Food Sharing App:
Develop a mobile app that allows individuals, local businesses, and restaurants to share surplus food with the community. Users can post excess food they have, and others in the vicinity can request or collect it. This fosters community collaboration and ensures that surplus food gets consumed instead of wasted.

Machine Learning-Powered Meal Planning:
Build a platform that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze users' food purchasing and consumption patterns. The system can then suggest personalized meal plans, shopping lists, and portion sizes to minimize food waste. It can adapt recommendations based on changing preferences and lifestyles.

Food Expiry Date Reminder System:
Create a reminder system that tracks the expiration dates of various food items in a household. Users can input their grocery purchases, and the system will send timely reminders to consume or donate items before they expire. Integration with smart home devices can enhance the user experience.

Upcycling Recipes Generator:
Develop an application that suggests creative recipes based on leftover or near-expiry ingredients. Users can input the items they have, and the system generates innovative recipes to encourage them to use leftovers effectively. This promotes sustainable cooking practices and reduces the likelihood of unused ingredients being discarded.
